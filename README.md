# Tikal Code Challenge

Greetings challenger, and welcome to the Star Wars rebel academy trials.
The following challenge is related to the Star Wars story.
This Star Wars API is an API that provides data regarding all Star Wars films and provides the
means to query many things like films, characters, planets, vehicles, etc.
Tip: read the entire assignment before you start (2 parts).
Part 1:
● The Star Wars story has many characters, some are pilots.
● Each vehicle can have multiple pilots.
● Each pilot might drive multiple vehicles and has a home planet.
● Each home planet has a population.
Your Challenge:
Use the Star Wars API to find:
Which vehicle names have the highest sum of population for all its pilots’ home planets?
You should print in a table the following information:

Vehicle name with the largest sum {vehicle name}

Related home planets and their respective
[{name}, {number}]
population
Related pilot names [{name}]

Tip: Have a look at the data returned from the API before starting to implement

Part 2:
Please create a bar chart that compares the home planets’ own population, without using any
charts libraries. No need to implement axis, but we do want to see a legend (see screenshot
below).
Use data for the planets [Tatooine, Alderaan, Naboo, Bespin, Endor].
It should look something like this:
